### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Stevie (they/them, he/him), a new web developer with a decade of experience in the media broadcast industry. In 2020, like many people, my life was deeply disrupted but I was privileged enough to be able to take pause, reflect, and step in a new career direction. I spent four months studying at [Enspiral DevAcademy](https://devacademy.co.nz/) in Wellington, Aotearoa, an intensive full-stack web development bootcamp, with an emphasis on human skills, Agile methodologies, and pair-programming. I am constantly astounded by the new possiblities of tech, and can't wait to begin my career after this life-changing course. I am early on in my tech journey, but my repositories will give you an idea of my ability to learn quickly and the variety of code I have been introduced to in the last year.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a few new projects; my first crack at building a full-stack app on my own. Watch this space. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently revising my course material across the stack, focusing on React, RESTful APIs, NPMs, and testing with Jest. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything and everything! My current languages are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with getting involved in contributing to open-source projects. 
- ðŸ’¬ I would love to hear from fellow queer and gender-diverse developers about meet-ups or sites I can find you on.
